# Getting-Started-with-APIs-for-Data-Engineers
This repository contains notebooks that accompanies a series of articles I am writing on APIs for data Engineers. The current notebook accompanies the second article in the series "APIs for Data Engineers (Part 2): Interacting with APIs; The Requests Library and the Structure of an API Request".  The notebook is designed to provide a detailed, hands-on walkthrough of how to interact with APIs using Python’s requests library. You can the series [here](https://medium.com/@ameenahlawal21) on medium.
# Overview
The notebook covers the following key topics:

Introduction to APIs:
A brief overview of what APIs are and why they’re important for data engineers.

Authentication:
Learn how to authenticate API requests using API keys, with examples from OpenWeatherMap and Football Data APIs.

Working with Parameters:
Discover how to use query parameters to filter and customize the data returned by an API.

Making API Requests:
Step-by-step examples of sending HTTP requests to interact with APIs.

Parsing API Responses:
How to handle and extract useful data from JSON responses.

Error Handling:
Techniques for handling errors when making API requests.

Request Bodies with PUT Requests:
An example of using the PUT method to update data on an API with a request body.

# Work in Progress
I am still working on this notebook and plan to add more examples and advanced use cases, such as handling pagination, working with rate limits, and making asynchronous API requests. Contributions and corrections are welcome!
